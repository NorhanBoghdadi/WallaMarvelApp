# Marvel Heroes Explorer

## Technical Excellence

### Advanced Architecture Implementation
The application implements a refined clean architecture pattern, ensuring clear separation of concerns while maintaining high cohesion and loose coupling. Each layer has well-defined responsibilities:

**Presentation Layer:**
- Implements MVVP pattern with protocol-oriented design
- Utilizes custom UIKit components for pixel-perfect UI
- Leverages modern Swift features for type-safe and maintainable code

**Domain Layer:**
- Pure business logic implementation
- Protocol-based abstractions enabling mock-ability
- Clear use case definitions promoting single responsibility

**Data Layer:**
- Robust networking with proper error handling
- Efficient data parsing and mapping
- Configurable API client supporting different environments

### Memory Management & Performance
Implemented several critical optimizations to ensure excellent performance and prevent memory leaks:

- Proper closure capturing using weak self references in async operations
- Strategic use of value types to minimize reference cycles
- Efficient image caching and loading using Kingfisher
- Automated memory leak detection in development
- UITableView cell reuse optimization
- Proper cleanup of notification observers and delegates

### Modern Swift Implementation
- Leverages Swift's latest features and best practices:
  - Structured concurrency with async/await
  - Result type for elegant error handling
  - Property wrappers for clean state management
  - Protocol-oriented programming
  - Generic constraints for type safety

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Network Layer Innovation
```swift
protocol NetworkServiceProtocol {
    func request<T: Decodable>(endpoint: MarvelEndpoint) async throws -> T
}
```

Our networking layer implements a protocol-based approach with generic constraints, enabling:
- Type-safe API responses
- Compile-time verification
- Easy testing through protocol conformance
- Proper error propagation

### Clean Data Flow
```
View Controller → Presenter → Repository → Network Service → API
↑                                                           ↓
UI ← Presenter ← Repository ← Network Service ← Data Models
```

## Requirements
- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.5+

## Getting Started

### Configuration
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure Marvel API credentials in `Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY</key>
<string>your_public_key</string>
<key>MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY</key>
<string>your_private_key</string>
```
3. Open `WallaMarvel.xcworkspace`

### Development Best Practices
- Follow SwiftLint rules configuration
- Maintain protocol-oriented approach
- Write unit tests for new features
- Document public interfaces
- Use dependency injection

## Testing
The project includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for data flow
- Network response testing

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

 GitHub Actions workflow ensures code quality and reliable deployments through automated processes. The pipeline includes:

### Workflow Steps
```yaml
name: iOS CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Select Xcode
      run: sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode_14.0.app
    - name: Build and Test
      run: |
        xcodebuild clean build test -workspace WallaMarvel.xcworkspace -scheme WallaMarvel -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'
```

### Automated Checks
